### - Open Source Definition
These guidelines ensure that open source software projects maintain integrity beyond simplifying making the source code public. They require open source projects to treat users and contributors equally, including everyone in the project. Doing so allows projects to receive feedback and contributions from the largest possible portion of users.

### - How To Ask Questions The Smart Way
This article informs readers about considering answerers when asking questions. Asking concise, precise, and well-formatted questions makes knowledgeable people more likely to respond. Putting in the extra time to research your question and ensure that it is not already answered in another common location (Google, user-manuals, StackOverflow) makes sure that you are not wasting the time of the person that's answering your question.

A suggestion I have for How To Answer Questions in a Helpful Way is to be more encouraging to new hackers. People that are just getting started with computer science tend to feel a large amount of imposter-syndrome and believe that they are not as qualified as they should be. The article does seem to give off the impression that question-askers are generally clueless individuals that are asking for help. This is generally not the case, as even highly knowledgeable hackers will need to ask for help often.

Another suggestion I have for the article is to make sure to mention that not all discussion boards have the same culture. Asking a technical question on a more casual forum will generally be more forgiving to beginner questions, so these are better places to begin. Other boards may have a userbase of experts, that are less likely to be friendly to simple and poorly-phrased questions. 

### - Free Culture Chapter 3 Summary
Chapter 3 of Free Culture shows the danger of our outdated legal system when applied to today's problems. Although Jesse had not stolen anything, extorted anyone, or distributed any pirated media, he was labeled a pirate by a business that he did not have the resources to fight. He ends up losing his $12,000 savings that he had earned through his summer jobs,  an amount that is worthless to an organization as large as the RIAA. The interaction that took place between the company and the innocent boy blatantly shows that our laws are obsolete in our current society. Since "stealing" is a very simple concept when it comes to physical property, laws around theft have been made strict and clear-cut. However, digital media and the internet heavily blur the definition of theft, leading to ambiguity in applying the law to court cases. Because of this, a boy with clean hands had been sued and labeled a pirate. Although the RIAA shamefully made an example of a student that was undeserving of punishment, they are also victims of our current piracy climate. As piracy results in heavy financial losses for media companies today, it makes a lot of sense for them to do anything they can to fight against distributors of pirated media.

## 6. Reflection

As mods for the game "Minecraft" are what sparked my interest in computer science, I am highly interested in making an open-source mod for the game. An early mod that I played with added computers and robots to the game, which was an incredibly fun way to learn the basics of programming. I would like to make a mod that educates players in a similar way: immersing them in a practical subject while they play the game.

There are over 55,000 mods for Minecraft made by individuals and teams, with the majority of them being open-source with repositories on GitHub. The mods are made using Java and include JSON files, images, and audio clips. They add content to the game and can educate players on a variety of topics. I have worked on a [Minecraft mod](https://github.com/AndrewKhans/Music-Magic) in the past, so I am acquainted with the process of developing a mod for the game. If I can find other members of OSS that are also interested in making a mod, I will certainly discuss ideas with them to see if we'd be able to collaborate on a project.
