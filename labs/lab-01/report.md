### - Open Source Definition
These guidelines ensure that open source software project maintain integrity beyond simplying making the source code public. They require open source projects to treat users and contributors equally, including everyone in the project. Doing so allows projects to receive feedback and contributions from the largest possible portion of users.

### - How To Ask Questions The Smart Way
This article informs readers about considering answerers when asking questions. Asking concice, precise, and well-formatted questions makes knowledgeable people more likely to respond. Putting in the extra time to research your question and ensure that it is not already answered in another common location (Google, user-manuals, stackoverflow) makes sure that you are not wasting the time of he person that's answering your question.

A suggestion I have for How To Answer Questions in a Helpful Way is to be more encouraging to new hackers. People that are just getting started with computer science tend to feel a large amount of imposter-syndrome, and believe that they are not as qualified as they should be. The article does seem to give off the impression that question-askers are generally clueless individuals that are asking for help. This is generally not the case, as even highly knowledgeable hackers will need to ask for help often.

Another suggestion I have for the article is to make sure to mention that not all discussion boards have the same culture. Asking a technical question on a more casual forum will generally be more forgiving to beginner questions, so these are better places to begin. Other boards may have a userbase of experts, that are less-likely to be friendly to simple and poorly-phrased questions.
