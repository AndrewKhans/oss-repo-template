## The Importance of a License
Licenses are important for software, as they define the permissions and responsibilities of the software's creators and users. They can grant the users permission to copy and distribute software, and they can impose restrictions on how the software is used. They allow for use of software that would otherwise infringe on the creator's copyright.

## Why You Shouldn't Use a Project That Doesn't Have an Explicit License
Without an explicit license, there is more ambiguity on how copyright law will be used. As a user, using software that doesn't have a license means that you are putting yourself at risk for legal action from the creator of the project. Additionally, a lack of an explicit license means that the software's creators do not have to fulfill promises they may have made in their marketing. A product may be marketed as "free and open," yet if it does not have a real open-source license, they are not legally required to actually deliver on their promises.

## Why the Web Beat Gopher: Failure to follow the Open System Model
I agree with the claim that failing to be an open system contributed to the fall of Gopher. In addition to the fact that being an open project allows for development from a larger amount of developers and promotes the integration of more user-feedback, open projects are generally more likely to be preferred by hackers. As hackers made up a large portion of early adopters of the internet, it makes sense that the project with the support of the general hacker population ends up winning out over the more-proprietary project.

## Android Uses the Apache License 2.0 and It's Kernel Uses Gpl V2
According to https://source.android.com/setup/start/licenses, Android uses the Apache License because allows for manufacturers of Android devices to make open and modifiable mobile devices, but it doesn't require them to do so. Since the license is the most permissive for manufacturers, it gives the operating system a competitive edge over iOS. Companies like Samsung that produce mobile devices will choose to work with Android, as they are given a lot of freedom to modify the operating system and release their product. However, due to the fact that Android uses Linux as its kernel, its kernel code is under the GPL v2 license. As they are not the creators of Linux, they do not have the ability to change the license of it.
